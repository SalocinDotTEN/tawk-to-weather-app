# PWA Icons Placeholder

Place your PWA icons in this directory with the following names:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

These icons should be square PNG files with the sizes indicated in their filenames.

For best results:
- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure the icon works well at small sizes
- Consider using maskable icons that work well with different device themes
- Use a transparent background or a background that matches your app's theme

You can also add apple-touch-icon.png (180x180) for iOS devices.
