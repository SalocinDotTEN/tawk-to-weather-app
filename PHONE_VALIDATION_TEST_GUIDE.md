# Phone Number Validation Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed

✅ **Fixed validation function**: Corrected regex that was removing the entire phone number
✅ **Added real-time validation**: Phone numbers are validated as you type
✅ **Enhanced form integration**: Phone validation now properly integrates with form validation
✅ **Added initial validation**: Component validates on mount and country change
✅ **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and validation feedback

## How to Test

### 1. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Navigate to Profile Page
1. Go to the app homepage
2. Navigate to the profile page
3. Click the "EDIT" button

### 3. Test Phone Number Validation

#### Valid Phone Numbers to Test:

**United States (+1):**
- `2345678901` (should become `+12345678901`)
- `(234) 567-8901` (should become `+12345678901`)
- `234-567-8901` (should become `+12345678901`)

**United Kingdom (+44):**
- Change country to UK
- `7911123456` (should become `+447911123456`)
- `07911 123 456` (should become `+447911123456`)

**Germany (+49):**
- Change country to Germany
- `30123456` (should become `+4930123456`)
- `030 123 456` (should become `+4930123456`)

#### Invalid Phone Numbers (should show errors):
- Empty field (when required)
- `123` (too short)
- `abcd` (non-numeric)
- `000000000000000` (too long/invalid)

### 4. Expected Behavior

✅ **Real-time validation**: Error messages appear as you type
✅ **Submit button disabled**: Button is disabled when phone number is invalid
✅ **Country switching**: Validation updates when you change countries
✅ **E.164 storage**: Valid numbers are stored in international format
✅ **Display formatting**: Numbers are displayed in user-friendly format

### 5. Debugging

Open browser console to see:
- Form validation logs
- Phone validation state changes
- Error messages and validation results

### 6. Common Test Cases

1. **Empty Field Test**:
   - Leave phone field empty
   - Submit button should be disabled
   - Error: "Phone number is required"

2. **Invalid Format Test**:
   - Enter "123"
   - Error: "Invalid phone number format"
   - Submit button disabled

3. **Valid Format Test**:
   - Enter "2345678901" (US)
   - No error shown
   - Submit button enabled
   - Should store as "+12345678901"

4. **Country Change Test**:
   - Enter valid US number
   - Change country to UK
   - Number should be re-validated for UK format
   - May become invalid if not a valid UK number

5. **Formatting Test**:
   - Enter "(234) 567-8901"
   - Should clean to "2345678901"
   - Should validate and format to "+12345678901"

## Key Components Updated

- `PhoneNumberInput.vue`: Main phone input component
- `CountrySelector.vue`: Country selection dropdown
- `phoneNumber.ts`: Validation utilities
- `profile.vue`: Updated to use new phone input
- `profile.ts`: Updated to handle E.164 format

## Validation Rules

1. **Required**: Phone number must not be empty (when required=true)
2. **Format**: Must be valid for selected country
3. **Length**: Must meet country-specific length requirements
4. **Characters**: Only digits allowed (formatting is auto-removed)
5. **Country**: Must be valid for the selected country code

The phone validation should now work correctly! Try entering different phone numbers and switching between countries to see the validation in action.
